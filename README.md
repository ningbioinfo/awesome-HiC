> Awesome collections of HiC-seq analysing softwares

The eukaryotic genome have hierarchical three_dimensional conformation, where physical contacts between chromatin have been proved to govern the regulation of gene expression. High-resolution chromosome conformation capture sequencing (HiC-seq) has been one of the most important methods to investigate the 3D genome since its first publication in 2009\. Since then, numerous of softwares and packages have been developed to facilitate the analysis of HiC-seq data.

Here is a curated **awesome** list of HiC-seq data related softwares/packages/intro-papers that are recommended for HiC data analysis and research.

## Pipelines

_Pipelines to process HiC-seq data from raw/trimmed data input to interactions/matrices output_

- [HiC-Pro](https://github.com/nservant/HiC-Pro) - An easy configured pipeline that can process raw data/trimmed data all the way to HiC interaction matrix, it is one of the most popular pipeline with a user-friendly documentation and it plays well with HPC.
- [Juicer](https://github.com/aidenlab/juicer) - Comes with a comprehensive Wiki and provides a couple of other tools for downstream analysis like a browser called JuiceBox for visualisation. The performance is very fast and it plays well with HPC, but it is not designed for data with relative low resolution.
## Toolkits

_Toolkits that containing multiple tools to analyse HiC-seq data_

- [diffHiC](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/diffHic.html) - Well documented user's guide and it has multiple functions for filtering, normalisation and identifying differential HiC interactions from multiple datasets. It is a R package so it can work well with lots of other R packages.
- [Homer](http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/interactions/) - Recently updated a new HiC workflow, including alignment, quality control, filtering, generating interaction matrix and normalisation, identifying TADs and loops. It can also generate configure file for circos plots.
- [TADbit](https://github.com/3DGenomes/TADbit) - A python library that contains multiple functions for analysing HiC data with its own TADs calling algorithm, and it has a well documented tutorial.
- [HiTC](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/HiTC.html) - Developed by the author of HiC-Pro.

## Mapping

_Softwares/packages to conduct alignments and filtering of HiC-seq data_

- [HiCUP](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/hicup/) - Provides well documented tutorial including YouTube videos, and it can generate a interactive html report as a result.
- Other mapping strategies can be found in pipelines & Toolkits.

## Normalisation

_Softwares/packages to conduct matrix normalisation of HiC-seq data_

- Explicit fashion

  - [HiCNorm](http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~junliu/HiCNorm/) - Included in the HiTC R package.

- Implicit fashion

  - [Iterative Correction and Eigenvector decomposition (ICE)](https://bitbucket.org/mirnylab/hiclib) - Included in the HiC-Pro pipeline.

## Visualisation

_Softwares/packages to conduct visualisation of HiC-seq data_

- [JuiceBox](https://github.com/aidenlab/Juicebox) - A part of the Juicer toolkit and it can also customise multiple types of data tracks, and it can plot gene loops on heatmaps.
- [HiCPlotter](https://github.com/kcakdemir/HiCPlotter) - Compatible with the HiC-Pro pipeline and easy to use.
- [Sushi](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Sushi.html) - A R package and one of the function is to take common HiC matrix as input to plot a heatmap.
- [HiGlass](http://higlass.io/) - A web-based browser and can also be run locally within a Docker container.

## Significant contacts identification

_Algorithms to identify significant contacts_

- [FitHiC](https://github.com/ay-lab/fithic) - Provides a two-step spline-fitting procedure and binomial model to identify significant interactions.
- [CHiCAGO](http://regulatorygenomicsgroup.org/chicago) - This model only works for capture HiC data, it uses negative binomial random model to model read counts and uses poisson random model to model sequencing errors and artefacts.

## Topologically-Associated Domains identification

_Algorithms to identify Topologically-Associated Domains (TADs)_

- [rGMAP](https://github.com/wbaopaul/rGMAP) - A R package including TADs calling functions and plotting functions for visualisation, and it is able to identify sub-TADs.
- [HiTAD](https://github.com/XiaoTaoWang/TADLib) - A python library and has a comprehensive documentation for all the functions.
- [TopDom](http://zhoulab.usc.edu/TopDom/) - An easy to use R package.

## Scaffold long read assemblies

- [SALSA](https://github.com/marbl/SALSA) - Scaffold long read assemblies using HiC

## Other awesome softwares related to HiC-seq

_Other softwares/packages_
